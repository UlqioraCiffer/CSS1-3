        <h1>BIG BANG THEORIES</h1>
        <p>The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, including astronomy, physics, philosophy, and
            metaphysics. The following is an overview of different theories related to the cosmos:

        <div id="Bang">
            <h3>BIG BANG THEORY</h3>
            <p>This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. The Big Bang theory
                suggests that the history of the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago. As a
                result
                of the Big Bang, time, space, and all matter were created, leading to the expansion of the cosmos.

        <div id="Hole">
            <h3>BLACK HOLE THEORY</h3>
            <p>Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. These are regions where gravity is so
                intense
                that nothing, not even light, can escape. Black holes interact with nearby matter and can emit
                radiation.

        <div id="String">
            <h3>STRING THEORY</h3>
            <p id="textone">String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description of the physical world.
                According to this
                theory, we live in a three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might contain additional
                microscopic, non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined spaces with
                different sizes and characteristics.
            </p>


            <div id="Box">
                <p id="texttwo">Here are three key points about String Theory:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to provide a single framework that
                        explains
                        all fundamental forces and particles in the universe, including gravity, electromagnetism, and
                        quantum mechanics</li>
                    <li>Extra Dimensions: While we experience a three-dimensional space, string theory proposes the
                        existence of additional microscopic dimensions that are compactified, potentially influencing
                        the
                        laws of physics</li>
                    <li>Vibrating Strings: According to string theory, the fundamental building blocks of matter are not
                        point-like particles but rather one-dimensional "strings" that vibrate at different frequencies,
                        with each vibration corresponding to a different particle type.</li>
                </ul>
